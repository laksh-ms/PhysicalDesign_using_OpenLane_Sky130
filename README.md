# PhysicalDesign_using_OpenLane_Sky130
Advanced Physical Design project - A complete RTL to GDSII flow was carried out on Picorv32 SoC using OpenLane SkyWater-130nm Pdk, as part of the course "Advanced Physical Design using OpenLANE/Sky130" conducted by VLSI System Design Corporation.

#OpenLane
OpenLane is an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, CVC, SPEF-Extractor, KLayout and a number of custom scripts for design exploration and optimization. The flow performs all ASIC implementation steps from RTL all the way down to GDSII.

You can check out the documentation, including in-depth guides and reference manuals at ReadTheDocs.
